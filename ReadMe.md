# GitHub Dummy Commit Dockerized

This repository contains a Python script that performs a dummy commit on a GitHub repository every 12 hours. The script is Dockerized for easy deployment.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Docker: [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/github-dummy-commit-dockerized.git
   cd github-dummy-commit-dockerized
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the project root and populate it with your GitHub credentials and repository information:

   ```dotenv
   GITHUB_USERNAME=your_username
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_personal_access_token
   REPO_OWNER=your_repo_owner
   REPO_NAME=your_repo_name
   FILE_PATH=path/to/your/file.txt
   ```

   Replace the values with your actual GitHub credentials and repository information.

3. Build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t github-dummy-commit .
   ```

4. Run the Docker container:

   ```bash
   docker run -d --env-file .env github-dummy-commit
   ```

   This will start the script inside a Docker container, and it will perform a dummy commit every 12 hours.

## Customization

If you want to customize the script behavior or schedule, you can modify the `dummy_commit.py` file.
